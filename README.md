# Instructions to run the Aplication

- Go to the front folder and then run the commands.

> cd front

> npm install

> npm start

Attention: If you can't run the backend api, you can go to the back folder `cd back`, and then run `npx -p ./api server`.

- Colors and Iconography were added to improve the users interface, also i added loader icons like spinner to wait for the request.

- Once you pick a city you will notice that its name will appear green.

- The disabled icon will appear gray.

- When there are no city matches you will find the following picture:

# FUNCTIONALITY

- It's possible to deselect the cities from the list or from the labels.

- In the first request or in the filter request you can only see 10 results, but you can go to the next page  
  or go back.

# MAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND LIBRARIES

- I used the next:

  > React

  > Redux / Redux-Thunk

  > Webpack

  > Axios

  > SASS / BEM

  > Lodash / Debounce
